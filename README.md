# Deep Learning Algorithms


# 1. Artifical Neural Network Algorithm(HandsOn Coded):  

  Implemented Artifical Neural Network using Keras library.keras will run top of the tensorflow and theon libraries.
  
  Code available in Github
  
# 2. Convolution Neural Network Algorithm(HandsOn Coded):

  Implemented Convolution Neural Network Using Keras library and image agumentation. 
  
  Code available in GitHub

# 3. Recurrent Neural Network Algorithm (HandsOn Coded) :

 Implemented Recurrent Neural Network using Keras library and we work RRN algorithm for sequencial data and RNN uses LSTM's Technique.
 
 code available in GitHub
 
# 4.Self Organisation Maps :

 HandsOn Coding Inprogress soon i will upload in github. Som is used to reduce the dimensonality and keep 2D.
 
# 5. Blotzmann Machine Algorithm :

 Handson Coding Inprogress soon i will upload in github. Blotzmann Machine used for recommandation system. Here we are not applying normal blotzmann machine we apply Restricted Blotzmann machine algorithm.
 
# 6. Auto Encoder Algorithm :
 
  Handson Coding Inprogress soon i will upload in github. AutoEncoder used for recommandation system.
  
  AutoEncode use Encoding and Decoding the data.
